This is a demo app for the DragSortListView library. The project is
hosted on GitHub with repo name: drag-sort-listview.

DragSortListView is an extension of Android's ListView widget that
mediates drag-and-drop reordering of list items. Its primary purpose
is to provide an empty "drop slot" that tracks the dragged item,
effectively reordering the list on-the-fly. DragSortListView also
handles the tricky task of scrolling while dragging items over a long
list. Animated transitions give the process a seamless and intuitive
feel.

Several convenience features accompany the basic functionality
described above. The most common drag initiation and item removal
techniques have been implemented for you and are accessed through
simple XML attributes:<br/>
  • Drag initiation: on touch, on drag, on long-press<br/>
  • Item removal: on click, on fling, on slide<br/>

The first demo, "Basic usage playground," exposes the basic
features of the library through the menu. You can dynamically
change drag initiation and item removal methods and add
headers/footers to the list. The rest of the demos address more
advanced usage.

As you know, issues with the library that are voiced in the
comments will go unnoticed and left to wither. Please open an
issue ticket on the GitHub project page, or email me directly.
Thanks and happy dragging!
